# The Guide
This is a guide throughout the api reference, each method and class will be explained and used in a interactive example and in the end you will have an app built with the steer API. To follow the example while reading this document it is recomended that you install the dependencies below.

## Dependencies
If you want to follow the example with steer it is needed to install some dependencies first. These are python, flask, requests and pip.

It is assumed that you already have pip and python, if not install it and comeback later :). to Install *flask* and *requests* do the following:
```
$ pip install flask
$ pip install requests
```
