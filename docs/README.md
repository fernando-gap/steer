# What is Steer
Steer is URL creator for OAuth2 and Drive for Google APIs as mentioned [here](https://github.com/fernando-gap/steer#steer). Steer **does not**: make a **HTTP request**, create other types of OAuth2 URLs other than *Desktop & Mobile Apps*. The document is where methods and classes will be teaching you in how to use them.

# The Guide
This is a guide throughout the api reference, each method and class will be explained and used in a interactive example and in the end you will have an app built with the steer API. To follow the example while reading this document it is recomended that you install the dependencies below. 

## Dependencies
If you want to follow the example with steer it is needed to install some dependencies first. These are python, flask, requests and pip.

It is assumed that you already have pip and python, if not install it and comeback later :). to Install *flask* and *requests* do the following:
```
$ pip install flask
$ pip install requests
```
## The Application Example
The example that will be used in this guide **do not interfere** if you don't follow.

The app purpose is simple: each time the user executes the app a file is written in its Drive, the user can pass arguments to revoke the access, and update a file, also the application should be refreshing the token to avoid the user do the OAuth2 screen again.

The example is used inside a [project of google](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) it is assumed that you already have a project and the API keys to get started. 

# Packages
The Steer API has two packages oauth and drive which provides useful modules to handle Google API URLs.

To import the main packages:
```python
import steer.oauth.api as oauth
import steer.drive.upload as drive
```

where oauth is where the module of OAuth2 is provided (i. e. OAuth2 classes) and drive where will contain the drive upload methods and classes.

Steer also provides some extra modules to use OAuth2 that is:
```python
import steer.oauth.challenge as challenge
import steer.oauth.response as response
```

Where challenge is the *code_challenge* generated by you and used by Google to increase the security levels of a desktop app, Steer provides full support to this. 

The response module is to handle the response after the code exchange. It has two purposes: to get the *refresh_token* and *access_token* and to check whether the access_token is expired after some time (time given by google).
